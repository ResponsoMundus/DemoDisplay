                Have you ever played with the classic tank battle game, BattleCity? If so you will find this simple game very familiar. 
                This is a game I made with two of my friends as a coursework project when I was still studying for my Master's degree back in university. 
                The goal of the coursework is to implemented concurrency as practice. But my team and I decided to take this further into making a multiplayer 
                game from scratch for fun and challenge.
            </p>
            <image class="img-intext mx-auto d-block" src="images/battlecity/BattleCity-1.png"></image>
            <p class="py-3 px-5 english">
                So, after several weeks of work, the game is ready. We developed a server which can maintain multiple games of up to 5 players simultaneously 
                along with a client which is capable of communicating with server and renderring gameplay graphics in real time.
            </p>

            <p class="py-3 px-5 english">
                On the server side, when a player connects it starts a simple process of a handshake and, after that, it will either start a new game or find 
                the newest on-going game for the player to join. 
                We made the server to update the maps it maintains and send those information back to the players at the rate of one tick per second. 
                So, when a client sends an input to server, it will cache the input and wait until the next tick to update the change. 
                If a winner emerges in a game, the server will send the client an end message and kills the game process to save resources for on-going games.
            </p>
            <p class="py-3 px-5 english">
                For the client, it listens to keyboard inputs of the player and send player actions in pre-determined code to server. It supports inputs from 
                arrow keys for movement and left shift key for fire. After receiving a message from server, it will either rerender the graphics according to 
                the latest map information or prompt a message informing the players of their tank's demise or which player is the winner.

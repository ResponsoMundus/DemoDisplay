                A friend and I got the game Tom Clancy's The Division 2 which was on sale at UConnect several weeks ago. After finishing the storyline of Division 2, I 
                got curious that how to build a TPS game like that and give myself the mission to find out more about this topic on Google. This search brought me to various 
                tutorials from different content creators on Youtube. After going through most of them, I believed that it was time for me to build my own TPS Prototype with  
                Unreal Engine 4.
            </p>
            <p class="py-3 px-5 english">
                So the first goal I set was to implement basic 8-way movement systems for player character in different different modes, for example unarmed and holding a rifle. 
                To do this, I created my own BlendSpace with animations form kubold's animsets and created an Animation Blueprint which updates character animation according to 
                character movement information, such as speed and direction, it captured. And to get a more responsive character control, I also implemented turn in place animations.
                So here is the outcome.

                After basic animations done, I decided to also make a cover system so the game can be more like mainstream TPS games, such as Division 2. And, this system turned 
                out to be harder than I thought. The tutorials I was following used root-motion aniamtions while I was using in-place animations and it was hard to adjust those 
                in-place animations to act like root-motion animations. Though I did not implemented cover for side arms because I do not have cover animations for side arms, I am 
                just glad that I made it.
            </p>
            <image class="mx-auto d-block" src="images/TPS/TPS-Cover.gif"></image>
            <p class="py-3 px-5 english">
                As you can see in the gif for cover system, I also implemented an UI that appears when player hit right mouse button to zoom in for better aims.
            </p>
            <p class="py-3 px-5 english">
                With all those done, I started working on AIs. After all, every TPS game has enemies to shoot at. And this is the first time I built AI with AIController and BehaviorTree 
                in Unreal Engine 4. Though the AI I implemented does not possess complicated logics, I am happy with how they behave at the moment.

            <p class="py-3 px-5 text-center english">AI Behavior</p>
            <p class="py-3 px-5 english">
                As my first fucntional TPS prototype game made in 2 weeks, I am quite pleased with it. And I do have several aspects that I want to improve. First, 
                I used in-place animations which had its limitations, and I want to renovate the animation system with root-motion animations for a better experience. And next, 
                I want to learn more about Behavior Trees and made AI smarter. Also, I would love to implement more movement functions such as jump, vault, and crouch.
